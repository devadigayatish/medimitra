##About Project - MediMitra

We are all aware of the growing ‘trust deficit’ between patients and doctors. Pune-Doctor-Patient-Forum seeks to bring together sane voices from within the community of doctors and patients to begin to overcome this situation and to foster rational, ethical health care.  

Not only patients but many doctors who want to do rational and ethical practice are suffering due to gross commercialization and consumerism which have led to irrational investigations, procedures and surgeries, kickbacks for referrals. As a result there is mutual loss of faith between doctors and patients.  

To overcome this situation would require a whole series of policy-measures to move towards a system wherein private-practitioners would be paid from public fund on the principle of ‘standard payment for standard care’ and hence doctor-patient relations would not based on the market-logic. Many of the doctors and citizen are aware that such system exists in some European countries, even in some third world countries and in Canada. This system is part of a national system called Universal Health Care (UHC). Yes, it’s a long way and quite an uphill task to bring UHC in India.  

However, even today some enlightened citizens and doctors can come together to foster relations based not on commercial logic but primarily geared to the spirit of giving and eliciting ethical professional health care. The Forum seeks to achieve this immediate objective and at the same time would try to contribute to the above mentioned long-term solution.
